*Explanation of 353A Domino*

Property of numbers:
even + even = even
even + odd = odd
odd + even = odd
odd + odd = even

Basically, if there are odd number of odds then the sum will be odd, otherwise even.

The question asks if we can ever get even sum on both sides. 

This is only possible when you can make even number of odds in both sides.

So, we save the count of odds we see in both sides

If both sides already have even odds then we don't have to do anything, the sum will be even on both the halves.

If one side has even odds and other side has odd odds then we can never have even odds on both sides.

So, we have got answers for two cases. The other case is when we have 
odd odds on both sides. In this case we can exchange one of the pair and 
then we will get even odds on both the sides.
Example:
2 1
3 4 
odds_left = 1 ; odds_right = 1
If we exchange 1st pair, then
odds_left = 2 ; odds_right = 0 - both side, the odds are even in count. 

But, does an exchange will always guarantee the change in count of odds?
Example:
1 1
2 4
odds_left = 1 ; odds_right = 1
If we exchange any pair, we still have odd odds on both sides. 
This is because exchanging a pair doesn't adds to anything.
So, we can see that if both the elements of the pair have same parity i.e both are odds the exchange doesn't results in any value. 
So we also save the total pairs that show parity. 
Now we have to see if the parity pairs do not cancel all our exchanges. 
They can cancel all exchanges when odd_left and odd_right are equal ; for any other case (odd_left < odd_right or odd_left > odd_right) we will have something to exchange for.
Example:
1 1
3 5
5 9
2 7
4 3
odd_left = 3 ; odd_right = 5  -> exchange 2 7 -> left = 4 ; right = 4

The only case when parity will cancel all our exchange possibilities is when odd_left == odd_right and this value is equal to parity.
Example:
1 1
3 5
7 1
2 4
odd left = 3 ; odd_right = 3  and parity = 3 ;
For some case like
1 2
4 3
odd_left = 1; odd_right = 1 and parity = 0 ;
So if odd_left == odd_right == parity then only in that case we won't be able to make both the sides sum as even.


Summing up all the cases:
1. odd_left is even and odd_right is even - sum is even - 0 moves
2. one of the count of odd is even and other is odd - even sum on both sides never possible - -1
3. odd_left is odd and odd_right is odd , even sum is possible when parity doesn't cancels the exchange possibilites
	odd_left == odd_right == parity -> -1 
	else 1 move
